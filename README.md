# **MonsterWrangler**
A simple game where you play as a knight trying to capture monsters. The player must navigate around the game board to capture the correct monster while avoiding the others. The player has five lives and two warps, and the game has an infinite number of rounds.

## **Getting Started**
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## **Prerequisites**
1. Python 3.x
2. Pygame library
3. The fonts, images and audios used in the program

## **Installing**
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
**git clone https://github.com/yourUsername/MonsterWrangler.git**

## **Running the Game**
Navigate to the project directory and run the following command in your terminal:
python3 Monster_Wrangler.py

## **How to Play**
The player controls a knight character at the bottom of the screen, and must catch monsters that appear at random locations on the screen.
Each round has multiple target monsters that the player must catch to earn points. The target monster is indicated at the top center of the screen, and is a randomly chosen type of monster.
If the player catches the target monster, they earn points based on the current round number and the time it took to catch the monster. The player must then catch the next target monster, which will be a different type of monster.
If the player catches the wrong type of monster, they lose a life. If the player loses all lives, the game is over.
The player can use a limited number of "warps" to instantly move to the bottom of the screen, which can be helpful for avoiding monsters or quickly getting to the next target monster.
The game has multiple rounds, and each round has more monsters than the previous round. The game ends when the player loses all lives.
The player can pause the game at any time by pressing the "Enter" key.

## **Customization**
You can customize the game in different ways such as:
1. Change the images and sounds: The game currently uses specific image and sound files that are loaded from a local directory. You can replace these files with your own images and sounds to customize the game's appearance and sound effects.
2. Adjust game mechanics: For example, you could change the scoring system, the number of lives the player has, the number of rounds per game, the speed of the monsters, or the warp ability.
3. Change the layout of the game window: You can adjust the size of the window, the position of the HUD elements, or the colors of the monsters and other elements.
4. Add new game features: For example, you could add power-ups that give the player temporary boosts, or obstacles that the player must avoid to catch the monsters.
5. Modify the controls: You can change the keys used to control the player, or add support for game controllers or touch screens.
